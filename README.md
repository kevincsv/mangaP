# ‚ùìAbout this project

This project is made in order to learn and put into practice my knowledge of JavaScript and later implementing
TypeScript on the BackEnd side, it was born as a personal project for the realization of sharing multimedia content for
free, It consists of a RESTful API, which allows to perform a CRUD, complete and partial searches with pagination and
image uploads.

## <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1487369371/1776/nodejs.png?1487369371"  width="35"> NodeJS

NodeJs was used to create the entire server environment using JavaScript as the main language with the implementation of
the newest features included in ES6 such as: Let, Const and Arrow functions.

## <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1487369371/1776/nodejs.png?1487369371"  width="35"> ExpressJS

ExpressJS was used as the main framework of the project to build the API environment.

## Algolia

Algolia is used as the custom search engine for the API since it has many functions that help to improve the
implementation of searches easily, in addition to providing a system that allows you to know what your users are looking
for, which helps to know how to easily direct the course of your project, In addition to that, it will also allow us to
search for partial and total information included in the database quickly and safely through indexes.

## AWS S3

AWS S3 It is used as the cloud storage system for all the images and files that need to be uploaded, in order to avoid
uploading all of them directly to the server.

# üí°Getting Started

To see how this project works you have two options

## üü°Option 1: Using Heroku environment

To test this API You can access the following [link](https://manga-bk.herokuapp.com/) and after accessing the link you
can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or any tool of your choice to interact with the
API.                                                                                                                                                             
The server is currently deployed in [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for learning purposes only, you can use all the
API features as you like to see how the API interacts.

## üü†Option 2: Cloning repository

> To use this method you'll need an account in - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/)

Clone the repository and follow these steps:

1. install all the dependencies using `npm i`.

2. Register in Algolia and get your API keys, indexes and your APP ID

2. Create a database in MongoDB using the tool of your preference either Atlas, Compass or Mongo Shell and configure it.
    - Get your MongoDB URI and your username and password, after this just go to the next step

3. If you already have your MongoDB URI with their respective username and password just create an **.env** file and put
   the necessary environment variables, and their values for it to work, the variables are in the example file **
   .env.example**.

4. After that you can easily use the command `npm run dev` to start the server in development mode and start interacting
   with it, by default the server runs on port 3000, you can use it or change it to the one you prefer in the main **
   index.ts** file.

## Interaction with the API

To interact with the api you will need an access token (JWT) to place in the Header, and it can be obtained by creating
a new user or logging in with any of the existing users.

To be quick and simple you can use the following credentials to get your token
> {
"email": "heroku@heroku.com",
"password": "heroku"
}

- Just paste it in the body in Postman or any tool of your choice and choose the method **POST** and send it to the
  server as a json using the following header `Content-Type` as the key and `application/json` as the value.
- This json must be sent to the following EndPoint to receive the Access
  Token https://manga-bk.herokuapp.com/users/signin, if you have any question just follow the following pictures as a
  guide.

### Header

![Signin example 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29514668/118193890-c0c96080-b448-11eb-9635-672201687de3.png)

### Body

![Signin example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29514668/118193546-2b2dd100-b448-11eb-8efe-895e8b40d7a1.png)

after this you will receive a Token like this

`eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjYwN2M0YWIyY2Y0ZDFlMDc5NDBiOThjZiIsImlhdCI6MTYxOTA4NDk3OSwiZXhwIjoxNjE5MTcxMzc5fQ.yQL6octsE4scC2xj5UNwUuNETZsxWqyRyJlcpFigpao`

Now you need to add a new header with the key `x-access-token` using your token as the value, your token will expire
after 1 day, that way you don't have to worry about repeating these steps again.

The main EndPoint of the API is the following:

- [Mangas](https://manga-bk.herokuapp.com/mangas) it shows a list of all the information stored in the DataBase, just
  click on the embedded link or copy and paste the following link in your preferred Tool to interact with
  API's. https://manga-bk.herokuapp.com/mangas

This endpoint can interact with the complete **CRUD**, being able to send requests with the methods, **GET, POST, PUT,
DELETE.**

The **GET** method accepts as a parameter any ID that already exists and will return all the information regarding that
ID, here is an example of the Endpoint
> https://manga-bk.herokuapp.com/mangas/609ffa45fbe4925aa004e503.

If you make a request to that Endpoint you will receive a response similar to this

![Response example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29514668/118373063-f8551b80-b5b4-11eb-9661-8377b0bdd968.png)

In the same way that you can filter by ID, you can search the data using `'title' and 'author'` by simply adding to the
query what you want to search, look at the following example as a
guide `https://manga-bk.herokuapp.com/mangas?search=YOURTEXT`

### Query Search example

![Query example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29514668/118373228-05bed580-b5b6-11eb-800f-f87f9ce496d1.png)

### Response

![Query response](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29514668/118373256-2424d100-b5b6-11eb-9f25-646bbd93a25a.png)

in addition, you can request all the docs in the database and select how many you want to get in your response
using `limit=NUMBERSONLY` for your limit and `page=NUMBERSONLY` to select the page you want to see

### Limit example

![Limit query example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29514668/118373463-33f0e500-b5b7-11eb-8b4a-cc937cfa5c7c.png)

### Response

![Limit response](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29514668/118373384-c93fa980-b5b6-11eb-933c-382e282e39a1.png)

### Limit and page example

![limit and page query example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29514668/118373468-466b1e80-b5b7-11eb-9d03-3d0f714deba3.png)

### Response

![limit and page response](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29514668/118373408-f1c7a380-b5b6-11eb-9599-72e40209b7fc.png)

The **POST** method only accepts the following keys: `title, author, description`.

The **PUT** method needs the ID to be able to update the values, as the **GET** filtering it is placed as a parameter in
the EndPoint.

The **DELETE** method needs the ID to be able to delete the information.

If you find any problem in my code or anything else, feel free to contact me, open an issue or do a pull request, that
way I can keep learning, and I can improve the code so that way anyone else can learn from it in the best way.
